# ConstructionSafetySimulator

<strong>Instructions for setting up repository</strong>

The easiest way to manage git projects if you're unfamiliar with git, or you just want something simple, is to download GitHub desktop and sign in with your GitHub account. This is what I'm using for this project and it's great. Highly recommended. 

Another important tool: Unity Hub. It makes it really easy to manage your unity projects. 

<strong>Step 1: Cloning The Repo</strong>
In GitHub desktop, select the option to clone a repository, use this link:<br />
https://github.com/WillJenkins/ConstructionSafetySimulator.git <br />
make sure and put it in a folder that's easy for you to find. 

This step will copy all the contents of the repo to your machine, but it is not a complete Unity project yet. 
Unity projects contain a lot of machine specific files that will need to be added in by your machine.

<strong>Step 2: Adding The Project To Unity</strong><br />
Open Unity Hub. Click on "ADD" in the top right corner. Navigate to the cloned repository you just made and select 
the folder "ConstructionSafetySimulator" that's INSIDE the parent folder. In other words, you want to select the folder 
called "ConstructionSafetySimulator" that's in the same folder as README.md, gitignore, etc.

Now you should see the project in your Unity Hub. Once you open it, it should fill in the remaining components of the project.
