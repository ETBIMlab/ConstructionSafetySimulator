How To Duplicate Terrain (without making changes to orginal terrain)


1. Create a new folder to hold your new terrain scene and terrain data

2. Create a new scene (if not already created for your terrain)

3. Copy the "TerrainCopyData" Folder into your new folder using Windows Explorer (Unity has trouble with copy/pasting files)
	-Doing this will create a copy of the actual terrain data, this is where all custom data will be stored
	-Give this folder a new name to keep track of the terrain data name (optional but recommended)

4. Copy the "Terrain" gameobject, with all of the Terrain children, into your new scene


IMPORTANT!!! 
At this point, the terrain you copied will still be linked up to the old terrain data from the orginal scene.
We need to replace each terrain gameobject Terrain0 - Terrain15 with the new terrain data copy in your new scene folder


5. Click on the inspector window context menu (3 dots) and select Debug mode
	-This will allow you to see the terrain data being referenced
	-Notice how the Terrain component and the Terrain Collider component have a spot for Terrain Data

6. Open up your new terrain copy data folder in the project window for easy access

7. For EACH Terrain gameobject child of Terrain (Terrain0 through Terrain15):
	1. Click on TerrainX
	2. Replace the Terrain Data of TerrainX with the corresponding new terrain data copy called "TerrainX"
		-Make sure you aren't in the old TerrainFolder! 
		-Verify by clicking on it in the inspector, it should highlight the project folder you are already in
	3. Make sure to replace the Terrain Data of TerrainX for component Terrain AND the component Terrain Collider

8. Verify that all have been replaced by editing all of the terrain tiles, and checking the original scene to make sure nothing has been edited.
	-Go back and make adjustments if a relink was missed in the process. It's tedious but a lot better than it was before I labelled the terrains by number.

You have now made a copy of the terrain, repeat this process whenever you need a new duplicate!
